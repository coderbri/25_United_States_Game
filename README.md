# 25 U.S. States Game

<!-- TODO: create a readme for this project containing an overview, the concepts implemented, the project logic, and finally acknowledgements that it was an inspiration of an online guessing quiz game () built as part of a Python learning journey through Angela Yu's 100 Days of: Python Pro Bootcamp -->


## Overview

The game displays a blank map of the United States. Players are prompted to guess the names of U.S. states. As correct guesses are entered, the state name appears at its respective location on the map.

This is an educational and interactive way to reinforce U.S. geography knowledge while practicing Python GUI programming.

## Concepts Implemented

- Python Turtle graphics
- Event-driven programming
- User input handling with `screen.textinput()`
- CSV data reading with `pandas`
- GUI interaction via mouse clicks
- Coordinate mapping on custom shapes

---

## Project Logic (in progress)

1. Load blank map image of the U.S.
2. Prompt user to guess a state's name.
3. If correct, display the name at the correct coordinates on the map.
4. Keep the screen interactive for future guesses.
5. Future: Make it fully interactive with mouse-based state selection.
